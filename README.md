In auto metro train the proposed autonomous train system is capable of detecting the station and automatically opens and the closes the door. The controlling device of the whole system is an Arduino, IR sensors, BIR and FIR relay, buzzer, DC motors drive, LCD display & battery are interfaced to Arduino. The IR sensors feds the input to Arduino and through this input it detects the station. The Arduino stops the train once station is detected and automatically opens the door. The number of persons in and out is displayed on LCD this working happens for every station. It contains Arduino based controller programmed using Arduino C which facilitates the programmed stopping of train from one station to the other. There are three motives behind building this project. Our aim is to reduce man power to large extent. This technology is used to generate automatic messages and warnings which enhance the safety of passengers. It also contains automated framework. This project helps people who travel huge distances to reach their workstations.# Auto-Metro-Train-Shuttling-Between-Stations
Railway is a largest means of transportation in India and it is Ranked in the world as fourth largest railway network. So, existing metro system needs to be modernized and equipped with automatic train control and safety system in order to make them more efficient. The rail transport system has undergone a high transformation, starting from the early steam operated engines to the most recent bullet train. In metro systems, automation refers to the process in which responsibility for operation of the trains is transferred from the driver to the train control system.

Train systems often provide advantages such as speed, efficiency, and reduced environmental impact compared to other forms of transportation. They can alleviate traffic congestion, offer a reliable schedule, and contribute to urban Sustainability. Auto Metro trains and traditional trains serve different purposes and have distinct advantages. Auto Metro trains are typically designed for urban mass transit, offering quick point-to-point travel within cities. They excel in frequent stops, high passenger volumes, and reducing road congestion in densely populated areas.

Traditional trains, on the other hand, are better suited for longer distances between cities and transporting larger quantities of goods. Additionally, Auto metros are generally considered safer and more cost-effective in the long run for densely populated areas. Automated metro trains can offer benefits like consistent acceleration and deceleration, reduced energy consumption, and enhanced safety through automated control systems. These features contribute to a more reliable and efficient transportation system, potentially leading to increased passenger satisfaction and reduced operational costs. However, the importance of automated metro trains depends on specific factors such as the urban environment, available technology, and the goals of the transportation system.
Even though, the accidents of trains are increasing day by day. Main cause of accidents and crashes are due to human errors and more than half of the people's death is due to accidents. To prevent this problem, we have introduced a prototype of auto metro train where human interruption is not required. The objective of this paper is to drive the train automatically. This technology is implemented in many countries like France, Germany etc.

The main aim is to represent the technology used in shuttling metro train between stations. Processor doesn't have a probability of doing errors but a man can do a mistake. The control of a train depends on the Arduino programming. Considering the safety of passengers, we had used a flame sensor, whenever causing a fire accident it gives a signal to the passengers. Due to the human errors many accidents occur. In electric trains fault occurring chances are more. Metro Train is an integrated application which displays and announces the station names when it reaches a particular station.

The Auto metro train system represents a pinnacle of modern urban transportation, seamlessly blending cutting-edge technology, efficiency, and convenience. Designed to navigate densely populated cities, the Auto metro trains serve as a lifeline for commuters, offering swift and reliable travel experiences. At its core, the Auto metro is an automated metro system, revolutionizing public transit with its driverless operations. This innovation enables precise and efficient scheduling, minimizing delays and optimizing travel times. With a reliance on advanced sensors, intricate algorithms, and state-of-the-art control systems, these trains glide along elevated tracks or through underground tunnels, crisscrossing cityscapes without the need for human intervention. One of the system's defining characteristics is its commitment to safety. While the absence of on board drivers might raise concerns, the Auto metros safety measures are unparalleled. Redundant. fail-safes, real-time monitoring, and emergency protocols ensure passenger security, instilling confidence in the system's reliability.
One of the key advantages of auto metro trains lies in their precision and reliability. By eliminating the human factor in driving, these trains adhere to strict schedules and operate with consistent efficiency. Passengers can rely on timely arrivals and departures, reducing the uncertainty associated with traditional public transportation systems. This reliability not only enhances the overall commuting experience but also fosters a sense of trust and dependence on the metro system.

Furthermore, the automated nature of these trains contributes to increased safety. The elimination

of human errors, such as driver fatigue or distractions, significantly reduces the likelihood of accidents. The auto metro system employs advanced technologies such as sensors and artificial intelligence to navigate through the tracks, ensuring a smooth and secure journey for passengers. This commitment to safety enhances the appeal of metro travel as a secure mode of transportation.

The environmental impact of auto metro trains is another noteworthy aspect. As these trains are often powered by electric or environmentally friendly energy sources, they contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions compared to traditional modes of transportation. This aligns with the global push towards sustainable and eco-friendly practices, making auto metro systems a viable component of green urban planning.

In terms of efficiency, auto metro trains are designed to optimize capacity and minimize energy consumption. Through smart scheduling and automated control systems, these trains can operate at optimal speeds, reducing travel time and energy usage. This not only benefits commuters by offering faster journeys but also enhances the overall sustainability of the transportation network.

In conclusion, the introduction of auto metro trains represents a paradigm shift in urban transportation, offering a sophisticated and efficient solution to address the challenges of contemporary city living. With benefits ranging from enhanced reliability and safety to environmental sustainability, these automated systems hold the potential to redefine the way people move within urban landscapes. As cities embrace the future of transportation, auto metro trains stand as a testament to innovation and progress in the quest for smarter and more sustainable urban mobility solutions.
